- Chapter 11 talks about the "Command and Control" phase of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
- > Command-and-control channels provide these remote management capabilities over the network.
- Covers 2 techniques:
    - Encrypted Channel
        - for this, both client and server must know (in bracket is what we are using in code samples):
            - Server IP (localhost)
            - Server Port (1337)
            - Data Location (TCP packet payload)
            - Encryption Algorithm (AES-CBC)
            - Encryption Key (16 byte key)

        - [EncryptedChannelSever.py](EncryptedChannelSever.py)
    - Protocol Tunneling
