- Chapter 9 talks about the "Lateral Movement" phase of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
- It has 2 techniques:
    - Remote Services
        - > Windows network shares are designed to provide remote access to files on a system.
            - Some shares exist by default...
                - ...which can provide far-reaching access.
            - Easiest way to defend them? Disable them.
                - Otherwise, monitor network traffic for abuse.
                    - Uses SMB protocol.
            - [RemoteServices.py](RemoteServices.py)
                - > However, by default, a local Administrator remotely accessing a file share will not have full Administrator-level access due to Windows User Access Controls (UAC) remote restrictions.
                    - > A Windows registry value located at `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System` manages these restrictions.
                        - > If the value LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy is set to 1, then full access to the administrative share (including Administrator-level privileges) is enabled.
            - [DetectSMB.py](DetectSMB.py)
    - Use Alternate Authentication Material
        - > ...after an initial authentication, many systems use alternative authentication material to store the authenticated user’s session state.
            - Examples:
                - Hashes
                - Kerberos Tickets
                - Access Tokens
                - Web Session Cookies
