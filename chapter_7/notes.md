- Chapter 7 focuses on the "Accessing Credentials" phase of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
    - We will bw using 2 techniques:
        - Credentials from Password Stores
            - > To provide a seamless experience, these passwords (saved on the webbrowser  ) are commonly protected with the user’s Windows password and the built-in cryptography of the underlying OS.
            - [ChromeDump.py](ChromeDump.py)
                - Since Chromes password store was encrypted with the Window's login key, instead of cracking it, we basically ask Windows to decrypt it for us.
                - Unable to decode final plain-text (utf-8 error), unsure why...
            - [DetectLocalStateAccess.py](DetectLocalStateAccess.py)
                - It seems to be accessing everything it needs to, but the [ChromeDump.py](ChromeDump.py) simply isn't creating any logs...perhaps the accesses it makes aren't creating logs?
        - Network Sniffing
            - Credentials may be visible in network traffic of systems with weaker security.
            - `scapy` can be used for network traffic analysis.
