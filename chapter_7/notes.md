            - > To provide a seamless experience, these passwords (saved on the webbrowser  ) are commonly protected with the user’s Windows password and the built-in cryptography of the underlying OS.
            - [ChromeDump.py](ChromeDump.py)
                - Since Chromes password store was encrypted with the Window's login key, instead of cracking it, we basically ask Windows to decrypt it for us.
                - Unable to decode final plain-text (utf-8 error), unsure why...
        - Network Sniffing
