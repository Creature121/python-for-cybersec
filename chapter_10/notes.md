- Chapter 10 discuses about the "Collection" phase of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
- 2 techniques are discussed:
    - Clipboard Data
        - The clipboard tends to collect sensitive data.
            - An attacker can:
                - Read, and gather valubale data.
                - Modify, and further the attack.
        - [ModifyClipboard.py](ModifyClipboard.py)
        - > Detection of applications stealing sensitive information by reading it from the clipboard is infeasible.
        - [MonitorClipboard.py](MonitorClipboard.py)
            - > However, it is possible to monitor for malicious modifications to the clipboard.
                - By having an allowlist, and notifying if unallowed process accessed the clipboard.
        
    - Email Collection
        - > ...email clients often cache email data for offline use, making it available to an attacker...
        - [LocalEmailFiles.py](LocalEmailFiles.py)
        - [FindEmailArchives.py](FindEmailArchives.py)
