- Chapter 3 focuses on the "Execution" phase of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
    - focusing on 2 techniques:
        - Scheduled Task/Job
        - Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)
            - [WMIExecution.py](WMIExecution.py)
            - [WMIDetection.py](WMIDetection.py)

- Admins use WMI to manage local/remote machines, via:
    - Server Message Block (SMB)
    - Remote Procedure Call Service (RPCS) 
- But attackers can also use WMI to:
    - achieve code execution
    - perform reconnaissance and other tasks.

- Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)
    - looks like it can run without admin? Will need to test it out more.
- xml package
    - looks like a neat package to parse xml...
