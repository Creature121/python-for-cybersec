- Chapter 3 focuses on the "Execution" phase of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
    - focusing on 2 techniques:
        - Scheduled Task/Job
            - allows an attacker achieve code execution,
                - as well as complicate forensics by breaking up the attack chain
            - Task scheduling in...
                - Windows: `schtasks` program
                - *nix: `cron` program
            - [TaskScheduler.py](TaskScheduler.py)
            - [ScheduleTracker.py](ScheduleTracker.py)
        - Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)
            - [WMIExecution.py](WMIExecution.py)
            - [WMIDetection.py](WMIDetection.py)

- Admins use WMI to manage local/remote machines, via:
    - Server Message Block (SMB)
    - Remote Procedure Call Service (RPCS) 
- But attackers can also use WMI to:
    - achieve code execution
    - perform reconnaissance and other tasks.

- Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)
    - looks like it can run without admin? Will need to test it out more.
- `xml` package
    - looks like a neat package to parse xml...
- Using task scheduling to run payloads
- `pathlib`
    - Feels like this make it much easier handling paths, rather than through `os`
    - `shelex` package made parsing certain things easy, look more into this.
